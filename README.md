# Protein Structure Predictor

## Brief Description

This is a python-based machine learning algorithm to predict the three-dimensional structure of a given sequence of amino acids. This predictor is still being actively studied in the field of computational biology. This will be looking particularly at the proteins responsible for transporting oxygen beneficial for the immune system, hemoglobin.

## Data Sources

## Data Fields associated with Data Source

The following are the data fields extracted from the data source in order to help extrapolate data along with a brief description explaining each data field:

- PDB ID - identifying protein structure with a combination of numerical and alphabetical values. 
- Atomic coordinates - atoms position within the protein structure. 
- Secondary structure - hydrogen bonding patterns in a protein.
- Ligands- molecules/ ions connected to the protein.
- Experimental Technique- protein structure determination methods

## Background information

This is a machine learning algorithm in order to predict the three dimensional structure of the input of an amino acid sequence. The importance of a 3D protein structural predictor is to further understand the function of proteins, development of new drugs and treatments. Along with helping related fields like medicine, and research, this predictor can also help fields such as agriculture, biofuels, and a lot more fields.

Proteins are essentially molecules made of amino acids connected with peptide bonds. The structure of protein is organized into four structures; primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The primary structure is a linear order of amino acids connected by peptide bonds, but the linear sequence is determined upon the genetic information (DNA) that specifically tells the sequence within the protein. The secondary structure is the patterns of folding of the amino acid sequence. These patterns are called alpha-helices, beta pleated sheets, and random coil regions. The difference between all these types of secondary protein structures are the spatial arrangement, for example in a alpha-helix amino acids are arranged in a spiral, while the beta-pleated sheets are arranged in a pattern of zig zags. While the random coil regions are arranged randomly hence the name random. The tertiary structure is is 
The three dimensional shape of the protein structure. The protein structure will display all the chemical bonds labeled as the covalent bonds such as the peptide bonds, and the non-covalent bonds such as the hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds, and hydrophobic bonds. The last structure involved in the protein structure is the quaternary structure. The quaternary structure is the combination of multiple protein molecules that’ll form a larger protein complex. The importance of the quaternary structure is the functionality and stability of the structure. For example, if the quaternary structure has weak bonds, referring to covalent or non-covalent bonds, between them, the structure’s stability will be at fault and hinder its functionality.

This is a machine learning algorithm for predicting the three dimensional structure of hemoglobin proteins. Hemoglobin proteins are responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues. The input will be a sequence of amino acids in FASTA format. This format is just single-letter codes. This process is rather extensive considering this process is used to produce energy for cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is the process of using the hemoglobin proteins transported oxygen in order to be used in the electron transport chain to break down organic molecules to produce energy. Without the hemoglobin protein during cellular respiration, the result would be death of cells.

The protein structure prediction model has plenty of real world applications. The ability to predict a protein structure can drastically improve and help scientists in the ability to produce new drugs and therapeutic treatments, upgrade the properties of proteins to enhance its efficiency, sustainability, and savings of cost. Outside of the biotechnology advantages of this predictor, it can also help farmers and their agricultural lifestyle because it can improve their crops being harvested. Understanding how proteins are involved in plant growth, farmers can optimize their cultivation strategies in order to increase their crops.

The protein structure prediction model can come with various limitations and challenges. These challenges can vary from the complexity of the information that’s being inputted into the model and outputted from the information that’s given, the limiting accuracy although it’s a machine learning protein structure prediction model compared to the traditional way to obtaining the three dimensional structure of a given protein, which in this case is called X-ray crystallography. X-ray crystallography is a technique for determining the structure of macromolecules and proteins from a crystallized version of the protein. A crystallized version of a protein is obtained by exposing it to high concentration of x-ray beams. In terms of precision, X-ray crystallography would be considered as the more precision tool for predicting three dimensional protein structures because of their higher resolution images and locations for particular atoms within the protein structure.
