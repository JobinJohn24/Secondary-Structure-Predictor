# 🧬🪢 Secondary Structure Predictor: DNA Risk Classification 🧬🪢

This bioinformatics pipeline brings together knot theory and genomic analysis. It aims to classify synthetic DNA sequences based on their structural and biological risks. The setup relies on five complementary metrics. Those metrics offer a thorough risk assessment for use in genetic engineering projects.

## 📋 Overview

This project looks twenty diverse DNA sequences. They cover risk profiles from low to medium-high. It draws on knot invariants and biophysical properties to predict secondary structure formation. The approach mixes topological analysis with standard bioinformatics methods. In that way, it offers a fresh take on risk stratification for synthetic biology.

## 📊 Dataset Profile

- **Sequences Analyzed**: 20 diverse DNA sequences
- **Risk Distribution**: 35 low-risk, 27 medium-risk, 0 high-risk, 0 critical-risk
- **Structural Variety**: Simple repeats, GC-rich, hairpin-prone, inverted structures, triplex-forming, palindromic, complex topologies

## 📖 Five Core Metrics
| Test | Metric | Mean | Standard Deviation | Finding |
|------|--------|------|---------|----------|
| **Test 1** | GC Content | 53.39% | 23.95% | Moderate thermal stability; optimal for synthetic applications |
| **Test 2** | Melting Temperature | 65.4°C | 9.8°C | Stable DNA denaturation profile; suitable for PCR |
| **Test 3** | Homopolymer Runs | 2.97 bp | — | 16.1% sequences problematic; structural risk indicator |
| **Test 4** | Shannon Entropy | 1.163 | 0.525 | Low-moderate complexity; secondary structure propensity |
| **Test 5** | Codon Bias | GAT/GAC | — | Complete analysis; expression-level risk assessment |

## 👨‍🔬 Results Interpretation

The five-metric approach worked well for stratifying things. It classified sequences right across the risk spectrum in an effective way. Topological features had a strong correlation. They showed high predictive value when it came to structural stability. The GC content sweet spot sits in the 50 to 60 percent range. That turns out optimal for applications in synthetic biology. Entropy plays a real role here. Sequences with lower entropy demonstrated significantly higher propensity for secondary structure. Codon choices matter too. The dominance of GAT and GAC points to considerations in design at the expression level.
